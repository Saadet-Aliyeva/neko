                <h4>Attack on Titan about:</h4>
                <span>Ago, mankind was brought to the brink of extinction by giants. Giants are tall, unintelligent-looking creatures that eat humans and, worst of all, do it for pleasure, not for sustenance, just like in the stories that have been told. Few humans survived under the protection of a city they surrounded by building walls higher than even the tallest giants. In the current time period, not a single giant has set foot in the city for over 100 years. Eren, a child who has not yet reached puberty, and his foster sister Mikasa witness the destruction of the city walls as a result of the attack of an incredibly large giant. Relatively smaller giants flock to the city through the breach in the walls, and these two children watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive by a giant. Eren swears that he will kill all the giants and avenge humanity.</span>
